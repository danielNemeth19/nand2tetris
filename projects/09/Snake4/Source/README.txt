----------------------------SNAKE -----------------------------
---------------------------------------------------------------

This folder contains my submission for project 9 of nand2tetris.
I have created an implementation of SNAKE in jack. The game
has the functionality to:
1 Move the snake.
2 Put food on the screen.
3 Let snake grow when it eats food.
4 Replace food on a pseudo random new location. The new location of food
is based on the user input (chosen direction) the old location and 
some jitter.

Missing functionality:
1 Game does not end when snake hits own tail.
2 No scoring.
3 No possibility to adjust the speed of the game.

Compiled code is in the Snake folder; jack source code is in the source folder.

Because of the time constraint I was not able to finish a full implementation
of the SNAKE game. However, I think that that what I did finish shows that I am 
capable of programming in the Jack language.

Have fun reviewing the game!!

Intro to Computer Systems - Project 9
This is my Project 9: a Snake game written in the Jack language. 
To play the game, first compile the code by making sure you have the Jack Compiler tool. Then you may enter the following command in your terminal/command line:
"JackCompiler.sh [insert directory name here]""
The directory you enter should be the folder that contains all of the .jack files.
Then, go into the VMEmulator tool and run the program (folder the .jack files are in) to play the game.
It is a typiacl Snake game, where you use the arrow keys to move the snake. If you hit the edge of the screen, the game will end. The goal is to eat the pellets that randomly display, which each give you 5 
points added to your score.

===================

Shoot your cannon to knock down the nine obstacles!
You've got nine shots to score up to 45 points.

Here are the game keys:

UP    arrow  Increase shooting elevation angle
DOWN  arrow  Decrease shooting elevation angle
LEFT  arrow  Decrease initial ball speed
RIGHT arrow  Increase initial ball speed
SPACE        Fire cannon!
Q            Quit game

Notes
=====

Parabolic Shot
--------------

The trajectory of a ball shot by the cannon is the typical parabola with the
following movement equations:

    x = vxi t
    y = vyi t - 1/2 g t^2

With

    vxi = vi cos a
    vyi = vi sin a

Where vi is the initial shooting speed, and a is the elevation angle.

See for example https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projectile_motion .

The equation constants are scaled in the game to keep the ball inside the
screen for typical time, speed and angle values.

The cos and sin functions are implemented in the program using a lookup table.
See trig.ods for details.

Random Numbers
--------------

To position the game obstacles at random locations, I have implemented a
rudimentary Linear Congruential Random Number Generator. See for example
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_congruential_generator .

To seed it, the generator keeps rolling in the splash screen till the user
presses a key.

Obstacle detection
------------------

To keep the game animations somewhat brisk, obstacle detection is done by
checking if the ball trace crosses any obstacle bounding rectangle between
times t and t+1 .

This means that sometimes the ball seems to "overshoot" an obstacle before the
obstacle disappears.


Bugs
====

Sometimes the emulator shows display artifacts after the shot trace is erased
in the game. I think this may be due to a race condition in the painting and
input threads of the emulator, but I'm not sure.

Vertical sections of the trajectory aren't drawn.

It may well be that an obstacle is placed just on top of the cannon. In this
case, you can make a nearly vertical shot to knock it down ;-)
